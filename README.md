# Eat-Da-Burger!

## Description

My assignment was to create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). I had to  follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

## Screenshots

The following images show the web application's appearance and functionality:
